#This repository contains code for using DHT22, LCD Display, Keyboard, Rotatory Encoder and a Potentiometer in atmega2560.
Usages:
DHT prints to the LCD the temperature and the humidity of the room
What I type on the keyboard is printed on the LCD
The rotator changes the brightness of a LED on the board and prints in the LCD its brightness.
The potentiometer takes a voltage between 0-5V and give it in an ADC and after that prints the analog value (0-5V) and the digital value as an uint8_t (0-255) of the analog voltage
